ML Project Caloories burnt
The Calories Burnt Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the number of calories burned during physical activities. The system uses measurable fitness parameters such as steps, minute heart beat to predict the energy expenditure of a person.

This project combines data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and regression-based machine learning techniques to produce an accurate calorie-burning prediction model.
